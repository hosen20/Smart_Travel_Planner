"""Domain-level exceptions.

Engineering standard: distinguish "the agent recovered" from "the agent
crashed". Tool failures are returned to the LLM as structured `ToolResult`s
so it can reason about them. These exceptions only fire for unrecoverable
problems (config wrong at boot, vector store unreachable, etc.).
